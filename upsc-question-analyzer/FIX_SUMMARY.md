# Fix Summary: /health Endpoint 500 Error

## Problem
The `/health` endpoint was returning a 500 error with "No such file or directory: 'config/config.json'" when running as a PyInstaller bundle.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Working Directory Issue**: The `runtime_hook.py` was changing the current working directory to the executable's directory, but bundled files are actually in the temporary `_MEIPASS` directory.

2. **Inconsistent PyInstaller Detection**: Different files were using different methods to detect if running as a bundle (`hasattr(sys, '_MEIPASS')` vs `getattr(sys, 'frozen', False)`).

3. **Output Directory Location**: The output directory was being created inside the temporary `_MEIPASS` directory, which is read-only and gets deleted when the app exits.

4. **Import Issues**: Module imports needed to handle both development and bundled environments.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed runtime_hook.py
- Removed the `os.chdir()` call that was changing the working directory
- Added environment variable `PYINSTALLER_EXE_DIR` to track the executable's directory for output files

### 2. Standardized PyInstaller Detection
- Changed `ollama_analyzer.py` to use `getattr(sys, 'frozen', False)` for consistency with `app.py`

### 3. Fixed Output Directory Handling
- Modified `app.py` to create output directories next to the executable when running as a bundle
- Updated the `WebAnalysisSession` class to use the correct output path based on execution context

### 4. Improved Module Imports
- Added try/except blocks in `excel_generator.py` and `main.py` to handle both relative and absolute imports
- This ensures modules can be imported correctly in both development and bundled environments

## How It Works Now

1. **Resource Files** (config, templates, etc.):
   - Development: Uses paths relative to the script location
   - Bundled: Uses paths relative to `sys._MEIPASS` (the temporary extraction directory)

2. **Output Files** (Excel reports):
   - Development: Created in the `output/` folder relative to the script
   - Bundled: Created in an `output/` folder next to the executable file

3. **Module Imports**:
   - Try relative imports first (for proper Python module structure)
   - Fall back to absolute imports (for PyInstaller compatibility)

## Testing
Created `test_paths.py` to verify path resolution in both environments. Run this script to verify all paths are resolved correctly.

## Result
The `/health` endpoint should now work correctly in both development and bundled executable environments, properly loading the config file and checking Ollama connectivity.
