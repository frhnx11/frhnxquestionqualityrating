3. **View Results**: Open the generated Excel file in `output/` folder

## Input Format

Place your questions file in the `input/` folder with this format:

```
Subject:Indian Physical Geography. Topic:Physiography   Subtopic:Western Ghats

**QUESTION 1**
--------------------
**Q:** With reference to the general characteristics of the Western Ghats, consider the following statements:
1. The Western Ghats stretch for 1,600 km, originating from the Narmada Valley and extending to Kanniyakumari.
2. The average elevation of the Western Ghats consistently decreases from the northern to the southern parts.
3. They rise abruptly from the Western Coastal Plain and feature a gentle slope on their eastern flank.
Which of the statements given above is/are correct?

   A. 1 and 2 only
   B. 3 only
   C. 1, 2 and 3
   D. 2 and 3 only

**Correct Answer:** B. 3 only

**Explanation:** Statement 1 is incorrect because the Western Ghats stretch from the Tapti Valley, not the Narmada Valley, to slightly north of Kanniyakumari. Statement 2 is incorrect as the elevation of the Western Ghats increases from north to south. Statement 3 is correct; the Western Ghats form an abrupt, steep-sided range facing the Western Coastal Plain, while their eastern flank slopes gently towards the Deccan tableland.

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Ollama Connection Failed**
   ```bash
   # Check if Ollama is running
   ollama list
   # Start Ollama if not running
   ollama serve
   ```

2. **Model Not Found**
   ```bash
   # Pull the required model
   ollama pull llama3.1:8b
   ```

3. **No Input Files**
   - Ensure `.txt` files are in the `input/` folder
   - Check file format matches the expected structure

4. **Excel File Issues**
   - Close Excel if the output file is open
   - Check write permissions in `output/` folder

### Performance Tips

- Use `llama3.1:8b` for fastest processing
- Close other applications to free up RAM
- Enable hardware acceleration if available
- Process in smaller batches for large question sets
